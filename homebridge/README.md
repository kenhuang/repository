This add-on provides the installation, configuration, and integration for
[Homebridge][homebridge].

## Deprecation warning

**This add-on is in a deprecated state!**

At this point it is unsure how long this add-on keeps available or
updated.

This add-on was originally developed to add HomeKit support to
Home Assistant. Meanwhile, Home Assistant gained native support
for HomeKit.

<https://www.home-assistant.io/components/homekit/>

Because of this, is very likely that the plugins this add-on rely, on
will no longer be developed or maintained.

We **STRONGLY** suggest to migrate to the Home Assistant HomeKit component.

## About

Homebridge is a server that emulates the iOS HomeKit API, allowing you to
control your Home Assistant via Apple devices (including Siri).

Since Siri supports devices added through HomeKit, this means that with
Homebridge you can ask Siri to control devices that don't have any support for
HomeKit at all. For instance, you could say:

- _Siri, unlock the back door._
- _Siri, open the garage door._
- _Siri, turn on the coffee maker._
- _Siri, turn on the living room lights._
- _Siri, good morning!_
